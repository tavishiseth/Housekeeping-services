# Housekeeping-services
(Application of heaps and dijkstra's algorithm)

We wish to create a miniature city with various houses as nodes of a connected
graph linked by pre-defined edges between them. We place our Housekeeping
Service station at one of these nodes.    
A customer can book a deep cleaning, laundry or repair service from his home. Every
time a request is made, it is added to the priority queue. The order in which
the services are provided is based on a first come first served basis or the overall shortest possible route.    
The shortest path between each stop is determined and the laundry, cleaning
and repair service professionals are notified with the most time efficient route
they need to follow to reach their customer homes.    
The expected time of arrival is calculated for each customer based on the edges of the time-weighted graph and the amount of
time he/she needs to spend at the previous stops. (let's say 100 minutes for cleaning
services)
